<h3>Quickstart</h3>

1. Make sure enemy color setting is set to deuteranopia.

2. Additionally, keybind the 'Fire' button to the button '0'. If that number is already in use, edit the keybind in `triggerbot.py`. However, it cannot be just the conventional mouse click (Vanguard prevents it).

<h3>Usage</h3>

Download ZIP, extract all, and run following command in Command Prompt (no changes need to be made as long as the folder is saved in Downloads):

```bash
cd C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\val-triggerbot-main\val-triggerbot-main
pip install -r requirements.txt
python triggerbot.py
```

For future uses after initialization, run the following command:

```bash
cd C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\val-triggerbot-main\val-triggerbot-main
python triggerbot.py
```

<h3>Halting the code</h3>

Simply hold down the `9` key on your keyboard. (Make sure not to type this number in chat)
