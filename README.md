<h3>Quickstart</h3>

1. Make sure enemy color setting is set to deuteranopia.

2. Additionally, keybind the 'Fire' button to the button '0'. If that number is already in use, edit the keybind in `triggerbot.py`. However, it cannot be just the conventional mouse click (Vanguard prevents it).

<h3>Usage</h3>

Run following command:

```bash
cd C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\val-triggerbot-main\val-triggerbot-main
pip install requirements.txt
python triggerbot.py
```
