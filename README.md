<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

1. Make sure enemy color setting is set to deuteranopia.

2. Additionally, keybind the 'Fire' button to the button '0'. If that number is already in use, edit the keybind in `triggerbot.py`. However, it cannot be just the conventional mouse click (Vanguard prevents it).

3. For faster screen recording, it is **recommended** (but not necessary) to set all settings to low, and to set FPS to a maximum of 120-144 (Generally, this is aligned with the refresh rate of your monitor). Unlimited FPS will greatly drain the bot's resources and memory.

<h3>Usage</h3>

1. Download ZIP, extract all, and run following command in Command Prompt (no changes need to be made as long as the folder is saved in Downloads):

```bash
cd C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\val-triggerbot-main\val-triggerbot-main
pip install -r requirements.txt
python triggerbot.py
```

2. For future uses after initialization, run the following command:

```bash
cd C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\val-triggerbot-main\val-triggerbot-main
python triggerbot.py
```

<h3>Using the bot</h3>

1. Upon running, you will have to select the gun you are going to use with the bot in order for the bot to spray depending on accuracy.

Simply type the gun in **all lowercase** with no extra spaces.

> Note that just for the Operator, you can just type `op`.

2. If the gun changes later on (which it most likely will), or you would like to exit the program, just type `alt + p` on your computer and open command prompt.
